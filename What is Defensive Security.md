# What is Defensive Security?

Defensive security, also known as cybersecurity, is a multifaceted approach to safeguarding individuals, organizations, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and other threats. It encompasses an array of measures and strategies to:

- Prevent security incidents by anticipating and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.
- Detect malicious activity swiftly and accurately to minimize damage.
- Respond effectively to threats by containing them, investigating the root cause, and implementing measures to prevent future occurrences.

## Key Objectives of Defensive Security:

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that sensitive information remains accessible only to authorized individuals.
- **Integrity:** Protecting data from unauthorized modification or alteration.
- **Availability:** Guaranteeing that legitimate users have uninterrupted access to systems and data.

## Core Components of Defensive Security:

- **Network Security:** Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and secure network architectures.
- **Endpoint Security:** Anti-virus, anti-malware, and data encryption software on desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.
- **Application Security:** Secure coding practices, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing for applications.
- **Data Security:** Data encryption, access controls, and data loss prevention (DLP) measures.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Strong authentication, authorization, and privileged access controls.
- **Security Awareness and Training:** Educating users about cybersecurity risks and best practices.
- **Incident Response:** A structured plan for detecting, investigating, and containing security incidents.
- **Security Compliance:** Adherence to relevant regulations and industry standards.

## Benefits of Defensive Security:

- Reduced risk of data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.
- Improved operational efficiency and productivity.
- Enhanced user trust and confidence in online interactions.
- Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
